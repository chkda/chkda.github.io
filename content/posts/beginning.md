Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.

### Why I Have Decided To Write

To be honest, I always wanted to started this. But for some reason was never able to. Now lot of the commitments have freed up. I can just simply do things that I like. Without any external goal in mind.

### What I'll Write About

- Technology
- Philosophy
- Personal experiences
- Economics
- Anything that I find interesting

I like reading about different things. I have some diverse interests. Also I think I am very curious. I don't really know what I specifically find interesting
